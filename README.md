# Ethereum Dashboard

This is a simple Ethereum dashboard built with Go, using Infura as the Ethereum client and displaying information about an Ethereum address.

## Features

- Displays the Ethereum address derived from a private key.
- Shows the balance in wei and Ether (ETH).
- Simulates a list of recent transactions (note: in a real implementation, you would fetch this data from an external source).

## Prerequisites

- Go (version 1.18 or later)
- An Infura account to get a project ID (replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` in the code)
- Your Ethereum private key (replace `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` in the code)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nagatejakachapuram/Eth-dashboard.git
   cd Eth-dashboard
